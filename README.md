# diffgeo
## Mathematica tensor calcualtions package

This is the repo contians very important and useful mathematica file.nb which is used for tensor calculations. 
As an example, I have used the package called **diffgeo** for evaluate **Riemann (curvature)**, **Ricci** tensor and also **RicciScalar** for [schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric) black holes. 

Furthermore, I can be used for various tensor calculations like **Covariant Derivative (CD)** and differential forms such as

- Hodge Duals
- Hodge Star
- Wedge Product
- Exterior Derivative
- ...
