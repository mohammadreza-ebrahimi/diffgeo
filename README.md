## Mathematica.nb tensor calculus package
> A package for doing GR-type tensor algebra and calculus. Compared to other such packages I know, it is easy to use and fairly comprehensive in the number of functions defined. "_Matthew Headrick_"

This is the repo contians very important and useful mathematica _file.nb_ which is used for tensor calculus. Anyone who is working on ***General Relativity*** can uses this.
I have used the **diffgeo** package in order to evaluate <font color='blue'> **Riemann (curvature)**</font>, **Ricci** tensor and also **RicciScalar** for [schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric) black holes as a simple example. 
In another one, again, I have evaluated aformentioned tensors for cosmology metric, **FRW** and showed metric contraction. 

Furthermore, it can be used for various tensor calculations like **Covariant Derivative (CD)** and differential forms such as

- Hodge Duals
- Hodge Star
- Wedge Product
- Exterior Derivative
- ...

Moreover, some other tensors are available in **diffgeo** where you can see and learn them easily in this repository. 

## Runnig diffgeo on Window\Linux\MacOs

That so easy. Just copy and paste ***difgeo.m*** in a _directory_. Then for runnig kernel with diffgeo package, you just need to use mathematica command ***SetDirectory["your diffgeo.m directory"]***. It will be run.

Please [cantact](mailto:m.reza.ebrahimi1995@gmail.com) me if you have any question.
